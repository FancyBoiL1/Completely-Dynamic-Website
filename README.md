# Completely Dynamic Website

> This repository uses JSDELIVR and Data URLs to create a (about 80-90%) totally dynamic website. 

Before teaching you how to do this on your own, we must go over the pros and cons of using this method.

Pros:
1. No hosting required. (Honestly best Pro)
2. Not traceable if using a disposable account (I hate getting doxxed by angry discord mods)
3. If a different CDN is used, you could make a completely private website that is only accessable by people with the link, without using a IP address or annoying login system.
4. A ton of web security knowledge is not needed to make a "secret" site.

Cons:
1. Debugging could be frustrating without using a host.
2. Loading times can sometimes be slow, or multiple refreshes could be required.
3. Working around CSP on mozilla is frustrating.
4. Some functions of creating a website won't be possible without an annoying amount of work.
